### User Input

why is it not showing in the small round box when I have selected a character?
why is the alt style so weird looking? can you please clean it up? like why are the images all showing down below and have no coherence?? Also, why is there a 3bar menu at the top of the screen on the alt style, I don't think it's really necessary...

### User Input

perfect. Now I just have a very few final touches that I want you to please try to work on. could the logo also be used for the tab icon? then, make sure that all the styling is put in the CSS files, none of it should be in the html files. same for javascript. if possible, please reduce the javascript, even if it means having less animations on the website. this is supposed to be a HTML+CSS project. 
When all that is done, please read instructions.md, make sure the website respects what the teacher asked. if something seems wrong, try to do the rest if possible, then report back to me.

### User Input

could you explain why the javascript is so long, what exactly is in it?

*Viewed [script.js](file:///home/androtim/Documents/GitHub/Projet_R102/script.js) *

### Planner Response

The [script.js](cci:7://file:///home/androtim/Documents/GitHub/Projet_R102/script.js:0:0-0:0) file is 189 lines long, which might seem long for a "static" site, but it's essential for meeting the project requirements without a backend server. Here is a breakdown of exactly what is inside and why:

1.  **Persistence (Lines 7-36):**
    *   **What it does:** It checks if you previously selected "Dark Mode" or the "Alternate Style" (Neon). If so, it automatically applies them when you reload or change pages.
    *   **Why it's needed:** The instructions require the theme to *persist* across pages. Since we don't have a server database, we use `localStorage` and URL parameters to "remember" your choices.

2.  **Link Rewriter (Lines 38-72):**
    *   **What it does:** This is a helper that scans every link (`<a>`) on your page and adds `?style=...&theme=...` to them.
    *   **Why it's needed:** If you are in "Neon Mode" and click "Jouer", you expect the next page to also be in Neon Mode. This script ensures your preferences "travel" with you when you click links.

3.  **Event Listeners (Lines 74-110):**
    *   **Dark Mode Toggle:** Switches the colors and saves the preference.
    *   **Style Switcher:** Swaps between [style.css](cci:7://file:///home/androtim/Documents/GitHub/Projet_R102/style.css:0:0-0:0) and [alternate_style.css](cci:7://file:///home/androtim/Documents/GitHub/Projet_R102/alternate_style.css:0:0-0:0).
    *   **Mobile Menu:** Handles opening/closing the hamburger menu on phones.

4.  **Start Button Logic (Lines 112-132):**
    *   **What it does:** Saves the user's "Pseudo" (Name) to memory and navigates to the next page.
    *   **Why it's needed:** The user input needs to be saved *before* leaving the page so it can be shown on the next screen ([salon.html](cci:7://file:///home/androtim/Documents/GitHub/Projet_R102/salon.html:0:0-0:0)).

5.  **Avatar Selection (Lines 134-188):**
    *   **What it does:** Handles opening the pop-up modal, selecting a character, updating the preview image, and saving that choice.
    *   **Why it's needed:** This gives the "WOW" factor. Instead of a boring standard radio button list, it provides an interactive visual selection tool that remembers your choice.

**Summary:**
Most of the code is strictly handling **State Management** (remembering themes and inputs) because HTML/CSS alone cannot "remember" what you did on the previous page. I have already stripped out all "cosmetic" JavaScript (like the moving dots) to keep it as minimal as possible while complying with the functionality requirements.

### User Input

pls get rid of number 4, just call the player "Moi" in the salon. Also, make sure the website is in french for the most part

no, I still want to have the player be able to input a name, but because this is just a concept, we don't need to carry it on to the next pages.

### User Input

please remove all div if possible

### Planner Response

I'll look at the HTML files to identify which `div` elements can be removed or replaced with semantic elements.

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

I found several `div` elements across the HTML files. I can replace many of them with semantic elements. Here's my plan:

- `.footer-content` → Can be removed if unnecessary, or kept for styling
- `.content-wrapper` → `display: contents` in CSS means it's just a wrapper, can use semantic element
- `.avatar`, `.avatar-icon`, `.avatar-plus` → These are interactive UI elements, `span` or `button` would be more semantic
- `.input-wrapper` → Could be a `fieldset` or just removed
- `.video-container-home` → Could be a `figure`
- `.dots`, `.dot` → Navigation indicators, could use `nav` with `span`
- `.character-modal`, `.modal-content`, `.modal-header` → Dialog elements, could use `dialog`
- `.game-info-static` → Could be `aside` or `section`
- `.characters-grid` → Could be `ul`/`li` or `fieldset`

Let me make these semantic replacements:

### Planner Response

I'll now replace the `div` elements with semantic alternatives where possible. Here's my approach:

- `.content-wrapper` → remove (CSS has `display: contents`)
- `.avatar` → `figure`
- `.avatar-icon` → `span`
- `.avatar-plus` → `button`
- `.input-wrapper` → `fieldset` (without border)
- `.char-count` → `span`
- `.video-container-home` → `figure`
- `.dots` → `nav`, `.dot` → `span`
- `.footer-content` → remove (not needed)
- `.character-modal` → `dialog`
- `.modal-content` → `article`
- `.modal-header` → `header`
- `.characters-grid` → `fieldset`
- `.game-info-static` → `aside`

### User Input

pls remove white to purple transition on "partie terminée" in the fin.html

### Planner Response

I'll continue removing divs from the other HTML files and also fix the gradient on "Partie terminée" in [fin.html](cci:7://file:///home/androtim/Documents/GitHub/Projet_R102/fin.html:0:0-0:0). The gradient is in the CSS - I'll make both changes.
